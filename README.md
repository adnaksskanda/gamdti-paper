## Thermodynamic integration error analysis paper 

This repository contains relevant scripts and notebooks for a research paper.

`init_structures` contains the PDB structure for hu4d5-5 we used for all hu4d5-5 mutation predictions
`TI_scripts` contains scripts we used to generate Amber input files for thermodynamic integration.
`model_example` contains TI lambda production data for hu4d5-5 VH-W95A, common functions used to process and plot the data, and a Jupyter notebook demonstrating our process in using GaMD end state sampling to mitigate the error due inadequate sampling of the bulky VH-W95 rotamer.
